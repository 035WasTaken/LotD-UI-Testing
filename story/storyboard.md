General idea so far is just to have it be a submarine underwater on some alien moon/planet and go from there. Unsettling/horror vibes.

# Current Timeline

## April 13th, 2304

World leaders discuss the merits of exploring the uncharted waters of Europa (barotrauma reference haha). Various methods of doing so are explored, costs discussed, and dangers documented. There is as of yet no sign of life on the moon.

## June 12th, 2304

One method is greenlit, the others are still in discussion, but chances of any of them being greenlit has just fallen drastically. The current exploration method would involve sending an unmanned submersible vessel capable of withstanding extreme pressure. There are rumors of plans to include self-defense measures within the vehicles external shell.

## December 25th, 2304

On Christmas day, development of the submersible and its method of delivery begins. There is as of yet no sign of life on the moon.

## October 1st, 2305

The first prototype of the submersibles shell is complete, testing of the prototype begins.

## November 5th, 2305

Complications arise in the connections between pieces of the shell, and it is discovered that they handle the pressure of our own ocean poorly at excessive depths for long periods of time. However, it seems the submersible holds up well to damage from extrinsic factors within the water. Recovery efforts begin.

## November 6th, 2305

Recovery of the shell is a success, and the damaged shell is moved back into labs. Development of the second prototype begins.

## December 31st, 2305

Issues arise with development of the second prototype shell, and it is determined that the current carbon-fiber supported shell is not strong enough to withstand the extreme pressures of Europa's oceans. A request is made to secure more funding for a stronger material.

## January 8th, 2306

The request is granted. With the new funds, acquisition of a stronger material is underway. There is as of yet no sign of life on the moon.

## March 3rd, 2306

Acquisition is successful, and development with the new materials is underway. This will be the first extraterrestrial application of ceramometallics, and is projected to serve as a major step forward in interplanetary space travel.

## June 22nd, 2307

Development is still underway, but a viable method for consistent stability throughout the submersible has been found, and previous defects are thought to be eliminated.

## July 3rd, 2307

A previously undocumented request for funds is approved. It is unknown what purpose these funds fulfill.

## July 27th, 2307

The current overseer of the submersible project is let go due to conflicting interests. Development is paused until further notice.

## July 30th, 2307

A new overseer is appointed to the project, and development continues.

## August 17th, 2307

All other proposed methods for the exploration of Europa are shot down simultaneously despite ongoing discussions. Focus is redirected to the project currently in development.

## August 28th, 2307

Another request for additional funds is made, and approved 4 hours later.

## February 9th, 2308

Plans for automated and/or remote-controlled exploration are dropped in favor of manned exploration. The reason given is monetary costs. ~~There is as of yet no sign of life on the moon.~~

## Timeline TBC...
