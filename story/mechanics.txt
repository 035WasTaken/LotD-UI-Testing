The mechanics really have nothing to do with story but. I'm putting the ideas here anyways.



Add "radar ping" or similar command to terminal in order to actually ping the radar. Maybe later on you can obtain an upgrade to do it continuously ?
It might be better to just have that be a separate command, and just have it be a bit less accurate. With the idea being that it might be automated detection
instead of manual from the main character.
